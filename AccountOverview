A lot of the projects in this account are projects I have completed throughout college. I am currently working as a Full Stack Developer at Wachusett Mountain
Ski Area, working on a website, background tasks, and multiple applications. Unfortunately though, I cannot post those on here for security reasons. I am also
currently working on my first game built with Unity engine, although progress on that has slowed as I balance over 40 hours of work a week and being a full-time 
grad student to get my Masters in May. Hopefully, when the ski season ends and things slow down a little, I will have time to finsih that and post it here. Thanks
for stopping by, and happy coding!
